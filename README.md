# theFamilyTree
The Family Tree Mapper 

Write code to model out the family tree so that:

• Given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’, you should output the people corresponding to the relationship in the
order in which they were added to the family tree.
• You should be able to add a child to any family in the tree through the mother.
